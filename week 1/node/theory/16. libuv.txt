libuv
<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
-->libuv is cross-platform support library which was originally written for NodeJS. It’s designed around the event-driven asynchronous I/O model.
-->The library provides much more than a simple abstraction over different I/O polling mechanisms: ‘handles’ and ‘streams’ provide a high level abstraction for sockets and other entities; cross-platform file I/O and threading functionality is also provided, amongst other things.
