Time Complexity
It’s a function describing the amount of time required to run an algorithm in terms of the size of the input. "Time" can mean the number of memory accesses performed, the number of comparisons between integers, the number of times some inner loop is executed, or some other natural unit related to the amount of real time the algorithm will take.

Space Complexity
It’s a function describing the amount of memory an algorithm takes in terms of the size of input to the algorithm. We often speak of "extra" memory needed, not counting the memory needed to store the input itself. Again, we use natural (but fixed-length) units to measure this.
Space complexity is sometimes ignored because the space used is minimal and/or obvious, however sometimes it becomes as important an issue as time.
