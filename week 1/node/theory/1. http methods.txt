HTTP Methods
<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.

GET
The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URL. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.

HEAD
Same as GET, but transfers the status line and header section only.

POST
A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.

PUT
Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.

DELETE
Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URL.

CONNECT
Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by a given URL.

OPTIONS
Describes the communication options for the target resource.

TRACE
Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.

PATCH
The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
